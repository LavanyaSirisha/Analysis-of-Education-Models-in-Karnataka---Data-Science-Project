# ANALYSIS OF EDUCATION SYSTEM IN KARNATAKA THROUGH DATA SCIENCE

## Introduction To Problem Statement
Education is one of the most vital parts of our life. India today is the second-largest higher education network in the world. Universities in India are set up by the Central or the State Governments by the means of legislation, while colleges are established by either State Governments or private bodies/trusts. The data associated with it is quite diverse and more or less unstructured. Through proper data analysis, we can get insights into the techniques and measures that can be taken to improve the quality of education in various parts of Karnataka. With this analysis, we hope to understand the trends in the literacy rates and enrollment rates in different categories of schools in various districts of Karnataka and which model of an educational institution is the most successful. In addition to this, we also analyzed the relation between students and teachers to suggest how the teachers should be appointed across all the districts in Karnataka to best help the students.
